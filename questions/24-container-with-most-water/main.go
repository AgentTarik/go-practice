/*
Container With Most Water (Two Pointers)

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn
such that the two endpoints of the i-th line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that holds the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
You may not slant the container.

Example 1:
  Input:  height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]
  Output: 49  (between index 1 and 8: min(8,7) * 7 = 49)

Example 2:
  Input:  height = [1, 1]
  Output: 1

Constraints:
  - 2 <= n <= 10^5
  - 0 <= height[i] <= 10^4
